<h1>Caiyzer</h1>
<p>Caiyzer is a underaged Mexican boy who has a disgusting mustache, only missing that specific haircut to become an "Edgar". He is extremely mediocre at Rainbow Six Siege and always tries to prove himself by 1v1ing Jynxzi. The result always ends up in Jynxzi's win. He was also groomed to be more of a streamer by Hivise with his frequent raids to Caiyzers channel, however he did not live up to Hivise's expectations, thus leading to a sharp decrease in raids on Twitch.</p>
