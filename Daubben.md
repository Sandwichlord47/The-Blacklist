<h1>Daubben/Mr. Last Alive</h1>
<p>Daubben is a professional baiter in Rainbow Six Siege and will make sure he is the last alive at least 70% of the time. In addition, he is very good at getting in stacks with Hivise and Garron and co. If Garron, Hivise, or Mimic are playing the game, Daubben is most likely in the stack. He often has beef with Mr. First Pick.</p>
